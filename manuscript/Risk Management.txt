The objectives of risk management are to increase the likelihood and impact of positive events and decrease the likelihood and impact of negative events.

Risk is an uncertain event that has a positive or negative impact. Known risks can be managed proactively or be assigned a contingency reserve.

Risk is accepted differently by organizations, depending on their risk appetite (willing to take in anticipation of a reward), risk tolerance (risk that can withstand) and risk threshold (limit of acceptable risk).

## Plan Risk Management (11.1.)

Process of defining how to conduct risk management.

Benefit: ensure that risk management is aligned with the risks and importance of the project. Risk management plan is vital to communicate and obtain agreement and support from all stakeholders.

Inputs: Project Charter, Stakeholder Register

Output: Risk Management Plan, which includes

* Methodology: approaches tools and data sources used to manage risk
* Roles and responsibilities
* Budgeting
* Timing
* Risk Categories (grouping potential causes of risk - RBS)
* Probability and impact matrix

{#section-11-2}
## Identify Risks (11.2.)

Determine which risks can affect the project and document their characteristics.

All project team is encouraged to identify risks. Subject matter experts from outside of the project can also be included.

Tools: Information gathering techniques (brainstorming, Delphi, interviews, root cause analysis); checklist analysis based on historical data or the lowest level of RBS; assumptions analysis; diagramming (fishbone, influence diagrams); SWOT analysis

Output: Risk Register (list of identified risks and potential responses)

{#section-11-3}
## Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (11.3.)

Prioritizing risks for further analysis by assessing their probability and impact. Establishing definitions for probability and impact help reduce the influence of bias in risk management.

Benefit: reduce uncertainty and focus on high-priority risks

Tools: probability and impact assessment; probability and impact matrix (probability from 0 to 1, and for example impact from 1 “no real impact” to 10 “project failure” passing by 6 “over budget or delay of 10 to 20%”); risk data quality assessment, risk categorization; risk urgency assessment.

Output: updates to documents, principally the Risk Register with the following information: probabilistic analysis of the project as a whole, prioritized list of risks, ...

{#section-11-4}
## Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (11.4.)

Numerically analyze the effects of risks on the overall project objectives.

Benefit: produce quantitative risk information to support decision making. It is done on risks prioritized in the Qualitative Risk Analysis.

Tools: data gathering and representation (interviewing, probability distributions); quantitative analysis (sensitivity analysis - tornado diagram, expected monetary value analysis, modeling and simulation)

Output: project document updates: probabilistic analysis of the project, probability of achieving objectives, prioritized list of quantified risks, trends in risk exposure.

{#section-11-5}
## Plan Risk Responses (11.5.)

Process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats.

Key benefits: address risks by priority, inserting them and the responses in baselines (budget, time)

Tools: strategies for negative risks: avoid, transfer, mitigate, accept; for positive risks: exploit, enhance, share, accept; contingent response strategies (fallback plan triggered under certain predefined conditions)

Output: update to projects plans and documents (schedule, cost, human resources, baselines). Updates to the risk register include:

* Agreed-upon strategies
* Contingency plans and triggers that call their executions
* Buget and activities to implement responses
* Residual risks (that remain after planned responses have been taken) and secondary risks

{#section-11-}
## Control Risks (11.6.)

Implement risk response plans, tracking identified risks, identify new risks.

Inputs: Risk Register, work performance data

Tools:

* Risk reassessment
* Risks audits: examine and document the effectiveness of risks responses as well as the effectiveness of risk management process. PM is responsible to ensure that audits are conducted regularly.
* Variance and trend analysis
* Reserve analysis

Outputs: Work Performance Information, change requests, documents updates and organizational process assets update.
