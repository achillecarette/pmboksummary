A>This process answers the questions: how will make-or-buy analysis be performed, what good and services need to be purchased, how will they be purchased, what are the potential sellers.
A>
A>It includes the following activities: make-or-buy analysis, create the procurement management plan; for each procurement create the SOW; select the contract type.

Input: scope statement, WBS, requirements documentation, resource requirement, cost estimates, risk register, organizational process assets: formal procurement policies, established prequalified sellers

Main types of contracts are:

1. Fixed price:
  1. Firm Fixed Price - FFP
  1. Fixed Price Incentive Fee (with incentive for performance)
  1. Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment - FP-EPA: for long term contracts
2. Cost-reimbursable:
  2. Cost Plus Fixed Fee - CPFF
  2. Cost Plus Incentive Fee - CPIF
  2. Cost Plus Award Fee - CPAF. The majority of the fee is earned on a broad subjective criteria at buyer's discretion.
3. Time and Materials. Note that a not-to-exceed cost limit or time limit may be specified to avoid uncontrolled growth.

Tools: Make-or-buy analysis, market research

Output:

* Procurement Management Plan, defining types of contracts to be used, metrics used to evaluate sellers, coordination with other project aspects, setting schedule dates for the contract deliverables and coordinating with schedule development and defining form and formats used for SOW;
* Statement of Work (SOW) which is developed in sufficient details from the scope baseline to permit to conduct procurements. Should be written to be clear, complete and concise.
* Procurement documents used to solicit proposals from prospective sellers: RFP/ RFB; Should be consistent with the value and risk associated with the planned procurement.

{#section-12-2}
## Conduct Procurements (12.2.)

Obtain sellers responses and award a contract.

Input: SOW, organizational process assets, seller proposals

{#section-12-3}
## Control Procurements (12.3.)

Manage procurement relationships, monitoring contract performance, making changes and corrections as appropriate.

Integration of the result of the contract execution in the project has impacts on the processes "Direct and manage Project Work", "Control Quality", "Perform Integrated Change Control" and "Control Risks". In addition, payments to the seller should be moniotred to ensure that they are closely linked to the seller progress as defined by the contract.

A>Constructive changes to a contract occur when the buyer gets in the way of performing its work. This could be because of actions (too much control) or inactions (failing to provide informations to conduct reviews). PM should be careful at this respect.
A>
A>The only person authorized to change a contract is the "contract administrator", who may be the procurement manager and not the PM. In this case, there is an additional layer and risks (if PM and procurement manager disagree)

Input: Agreements, work performance data and reports

Tools: Procurement performance reviews of the seller's progress as compared to the contract; inspections and audits, claims administration for contested changes (settlement is preferred); payment systems (in accordance with the terms of the contract), records management system.
