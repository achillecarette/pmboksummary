Introduction
============

All the book content is written using Leanpub's Markdown dialect - which is pure text including commands and formatting instructions.

This content reached 27 chapters and in order to keep it well organized, a few conventions need to be respected.


Files Organization
==================

Each PMBOK chapter has a separate file
Each file is named using the convention xx-yy-Name.txt, where
  xx is the section number
  yy is the chapter order within the section


Parts, chapters and sections
============================

The book has two parts, one for PMBOK 6 and the second one for PMBOK 5. They are marked as

-#

For example:
-# Project Management Guide to the Body of Knowledge, 6^th^ edition

Each PMBOK chapter has it own book chapter - typically one per file

{#p-x-ch-y}
# Chapter y title (chapter number in PMBOK)

For example. for the first chapter of the second part, relating to chapter 1. of the PMBOK
{p-2-ch-1}
# Introduction (1.)

Each chapter may have sections and sub-sections as

{#p-x-ch-y-z}
## Section title (section number in PMBOK)

For example, for the subsection 5.2 in chapter 1 of the part 2:
{#p-2-ch-1-5-2}
### Organizations and Project Management (1.5.2.)

This organization guarantees that bookmark ids are unique and easily referenceable.

They have two parts: the footnote id in the text [^x_y_z] and, at the bottom of the file, th footnote content as

[^x_y_z]: footnote content

x is the part number
y is the chapter number
